		Initially, it was a vacation house for a Zamindar of Jamalpur district, Sheikh Enayet Ullah. After his death, his son sold this property to the French traders in 1740. They dug a pond in front of the building where fresh water could be fetched. After having a great business in the subcontinent for almost a century, they surrendered under the full British power and sold all of their properties. So, in 1830, Khwaja Alimullah – an established man in Dhaka bought the property. He added a mosque in this compound. After his death, his son Khwaja Abdul Gani made some progressive look to the property and named it “Ahsan Manzil” after his son Ahsan Ullah.

			In 1985, Dhaka National Museum obtained this property and made it a museum after a long restoration process.

			The Palace is divided into 2 sides. ‘Rangmahal’ is at the eastern side. It was the entertainment spot where foreign and local girls used to dance and sing for the main owner Enayet Ullah. The Ballroom was also there at this portion. The Western side has living room, dining room, a library, card room and guest rooms. The Building is front-faced by the mighty Buriganga River.
