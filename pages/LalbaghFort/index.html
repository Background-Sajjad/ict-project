				The 17th century Mughal fort which stands by the Buriganga River is one of the oldest architecture of Bangladesh. It was built by the then Mughal Subahdar Muhammad Azam Shah, son of Emperor Aurangzeb. It is believed that the construction of the fort was never completed.

				The fort consists of 3 frameworks – (i) ‘Diwan-I-Aam’ which was the residence of the Governor, (ii) a mosque and (iii) the tomb of Bibi Pari who was the daughter of Emperor Saista Khan.

				Interestingly, there are some mysteries around this fort. There are tunnels underneath the fort which lead to the other side of the river. During the Sepoy Revolution of 1857, many soldiers tried to flee through those tunnels and died. Few British soldiers who followed them there, did not return. In fact, to investigate the situation, the researchers sent an elephant and a dog to those tunnels who didn’t come back as well. Soon after that horrific incident, the path was sealed.
