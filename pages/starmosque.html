				This mosque is based in Armanitola, Dhaka. A very antique mosque built by Mirza Golam Pir at 19th century.
			</p>
			<p>
			Built in Mughal style, initially, it was a simple rectangular mosque. The roof was crowned by 3 domes and covered with star shaped china clay tiles. These tiles are also seen in the exterior.

			Later, on the 20th century, a local businessman named Ali Jahan Bepari renovated the mosque. Started by adding a veranda, he repaired the tiles with mosaic. It was popular decoration by that time. Along with the domes, the exterior and the interior are done with star shaped tiles. That is why the mosque is called Star mosque. In 1987, the Ministry of Religious Affairs of Bangladesh added a new prayer hall which eventually led to 2 additional domes in the mosque.
