				This place lies in a village of Bogra district called ‘Mahasthan.’ ‘Garh’ means fort, so ‘Mahasthangarh’ means fort of Mahasthan.
			</p>
			<p>
				Francis Buchanan Hamilton, a Physician, first discovered this place in 1808. However, he made some significant contributions as a Geographer during his stay in Indian subcontinent. It is the last remaining piece of a village ‘Pundranagara’ of that time. The village was alive until the 8th century AD.

				This area is now preserved with nice natural hilly look to enjoy leisure. People from everywhere come to spend some quiet time here with natural serenity.
