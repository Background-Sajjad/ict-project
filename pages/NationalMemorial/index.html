			One of the most beautiful places in Savar, near Dhaka, is the National Memorial. It was founded to recall the memory of the 7 major War Heroes of the Liberation War in 1971.
			</p>
			<p>
				Bangladeshi Structural Engineer and Architect Syed Mainul Hossain designed this remarkable memorial. The monument consists of 7 different segments which are standing proudly together to represent the 7 War Heroes.

				Staggeringly, the complex has the area of 84 acres. National Parade, Scouting Display, Liberation War songs and related programs are displayed here annually, on the victory day, 16th December. Besides, itâ€™s a regular visiting spot for general people all of the time.
